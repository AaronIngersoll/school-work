<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>

<p><span class="bigtext">Question:</span> How is IS/IT different from Computer Science</p>
<p><span class="bigtext">Answer:</span> To be sure there is a degree of overlap between these disciplines. Both 
study computer hardware and software. Computer Science studies in depth the 
internal operations of computers and the development of systems software to make 
computers easy to use. IS/IT, on the other hand, is concerned more with the 
users and business uses of computers than with the computers themselves. IS/IT 
requires a moderate-level of programming and a little hardware knowledge; 
however, its primary focus is on using the technology to meet business needs. </p>
