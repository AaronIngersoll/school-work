        <h4>What was your first impression of this site?</h4>
        <p>I enjoyed the beautiful pictures on this website. I also thought it was very organized. You didn't get too lost in all the info on the website and I think that is really hard to do. It had great colors and had a way cool map that showed you pin points of the destinations so you can plan a trip.</p></li>
    <li>
        <h4>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</h4>
        <p>They made the links very clean and colorful so you know what you're clicking on and where to find it. The had the links on the left, as expected, and info on the right. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</h4>
        <p>It made sense. It was clear where the links and the information was. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</h4>
        <p>These Elements definitely enhance. I don't think a destination website withought graphics would be very compelling at all.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</h4>
        <p>It took about 7 seconds. It was reasonable. I have slow internet.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</h4>
        <p>Yes for the most part. I would say their smaller font was a little harder to read because it was lighter, and the background was white. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</h4>
        <p>The site didn't have a traditional bar, but it did have a side bar to find the different locations. It could have used a nav bar to get other kinds of information, like scheduling websites and utah officials.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</h4>
        <p>Yes, part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. It was clear what kind of info was where. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</h4>
        <p> they did really well with the responsiveness, large(computers),medium(tablets), and small(phones).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</h4>
        <p>The imagery of the locations, very well done and they presented them well.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</h4>

</li>
    <li>

    <li>
        <h4>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</h4>
    <p>ugh it had two! it was the worse. The better, more important, nav bar was hidden because tehy were trying clickbait above it.</p></li>
    <li>

    <li>
        <h4>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</h4>
    <p>It could be voted for one of the ugliest site created. It very much reminded me of this website: <a id="links" href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Lings cars</a> </p></li>

    <li>
        <h4>What was your first impression of this site?</h4>
    <p>What do these words say? The first thought was wow this is a pretty website, then I tried to figure out what it is and the main heading is so hard to read, it blends in with the background and you can definitely NOT see the links on this page</p>
</li>
    <li>
        <h4>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</h4>
    <p>This website has a hero design, so as you scroll more information comes up and the image, background, text change with it.</p></li>
    <li>
        <h4>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</h4>
        <p>It Makes sense. I like the website because it's very simple and guides you through the details.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</h4>
    <p>If they figured out a better way to see the text, I would definitely say it enhances it. I'm a sucker for a nice hero.</p></li>
    <li>
        <h4>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</h4>
    <p>It was fast. I was impressed with the speed with the multimedia behind it.</p></li>
    <li>
        <h4>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</h4>
        <p>Other then the home page where you can't read the white words, I would say yeah over oll it was good. Image enhanced, again just need to be able to read the information. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</h4>
    <p>In full view you can't read the navigation, but I really liked the hamburger style on the smaller views.</p></li>
    <li>
        <h4>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</h4>
    <p>It did, it was beautiful on most of the pages. </p></li>
    <li>
        <h4>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</h4>
    <p>it responds great! They have different icons for different sizes and the design is simple enough you can fit the data cleanly on smaller windows. Brilliant.</p></li>
    <li>
        <h4>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</h4>
    <p>It had an artistic feel about it. I loved the hero's and the slight variations on each page to make each artist look unique and have their own style.</p></li>
