              width="175px"> My favorite past time is cooking. I especially like cooking for family and
              friends. I was glad to find this web site about Native Cooking of Utah. I
              like to make sure the items I choose to cook meet the needs of my target
              audience. I have found the recipes in this collection to be wildly popular
              with my Utah neighbors and family members. My family especially loves the
              raspberry cake recipe. I am enclosing a photo of my version of the cake.
              <br />
              
              Thanks for adding spice to my cooking,
            </p>

              My name is Daisy Daniels and I have enjoyed using the recipes I have found
              at your web site. I thought I already knew how to cook like a Utahan, but
              I have been able to expand my repertoire after trying out some of your
              more unusual offerings. I like how these recipes are inexpensive to
              prepare, and they serve lots of people. The clean up usually is painless
              as well. I loved your green jello recipe. My family makes sure we never
              have leftovers when I fix this one.<br />
              <br />
              Thanks for everything,
            </p>

              width="175px"> Whenever I am at a loss about what to cook for dinner, I just go to your
              web site and I can always find an answer. The ingredients of your recipes
              are always reasonably priced so I won't have to worry about busting my
              budget. I was nervous about trying to make my own ice cream, but your Bear
              Lake Raspberry recipe made me brave enough to try it. The step by step
              directions were easy to follow and my kids really loved the ice cream. I
              am attaching a photo.<br />
              <br />
              I scream for your ice cream,
            </p>

              width="175px">Real men are not afraid to try Dutch oven cooking. I made an investment in
              equipment, but it sat in my garage until I found your wonderful recipes
              online. Now, I am a hit at family reunions and campouts. I have tried main
              dishes, deserts, and even baked rolls. My next attempt will be lasagna.
              Thanks for giving me the courage to try cooking the old fashioned way.<br />

              Warmly yours,
