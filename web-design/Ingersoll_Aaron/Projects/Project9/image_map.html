    In 1997, Master Chef Pierre DeBois moved to Utah from New York where he
    owned and managed a small restaurant called Ma Maison (My Home). His
    restaurant specialized in French Nouvelle cuisine. Once in Salt Lake City,
    he realized that the average Utahan doesn't have much appreciation for
    high cuisine. Pierre and his family were invited to a neighborhood block
    party one summer and it was there he had his first encounter with Native
    Cooking of Utah. Pierre noticed how much the locals enjoyed the items
    brought to this pot luck dinner. They often went back for seconds or
    thirds. How could he capture this enthusiasm for eating and translate it
    into his own cooking? In order to answer this question, he began a year
    long quest to find out the reason for the success of Utah cuisine.

    Pierre discovered there are some things that set apart Utah cooking from
    others:

    <li>Simplicity in preparation</li>
    <li>Inexpensive ingredients</li>

    <li>Ease of Serving and Cleanup</li>

  <h2 id="online-presence">Native Cooking of Utah Goes Online...</h2>
  <p>
    So in 2010, Pierre DeBois began gathering recipes for an online cookbook
    titled: Native Cooking of Utah. Everywhere he could, he begged, borrowed
    or stole the secret recipes of popular Utah cooks. Many of these recipes
    had been handed down from generation to generation. In fact, the most well
    known recipe for green jello even was honored with its own Olympic pin.
  </p>

  <p>
    The web site for Native Cooking of Utah organizes the recipes by area of
    the state. For example, salt water taffy from Salt Lake City, and Bear
    Lake Raspberry ice cream from Bear Lake. Chef Pierre DeBois has traveled
    the state to gather these recipes. Read the Guestbook to see comments and
    testimonials from satisfied cooks.

  <h2 id="future-of-native">Looking to the Future...</h2>
  <p>
    Native Cooking of Utah has become one of the most popular cooking sites in
    the Western U.S. with over 10,000 hits per week. Chef Pierre DeBois has
    plans to expand the site to include cooking utensils and kitchen
    accessories used or hand-made by native Utahans. Not only can you use this
    web site to help you to create true Utahan cuisine, now you can look the
    part. You will find these added treats online after January, 2013.
